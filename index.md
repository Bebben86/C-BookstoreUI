## ITHS DB Lab3 - Adding a UI to our bookstore-database

In DB Lab2, we created a SQL database and filled it with some data about books, authors, orders and more.
This little application is made in WindowsForms to manage that data.

The user can also add books and authors, make them inactive (instead of removing them all together), "connect" auhtor(s) to book(s) and a few more things.


Lab3 was made by Andreas Nilsson and Linnéa Netzell at ITHS Göteborg in 2021.
